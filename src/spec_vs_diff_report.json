  "summary": "The diff implements comprehensive admin authorization debugging and fixes for principal 'mhpch-6hb2j-phylo-7bgid-lmdtt-nd4to-wuert-h3mxk-4jz53-6meuu-iqe'. Backend changes include debug logging in main.mo with Debug.print statements tracking admin checks, caller principals, and authorization results. Frontend changes add extensive console.log statements in useIsAdmin hook, App.tsx, Layout.tsx, AdminDashboard.tsx, and MonthlyReportPage.tsx to track admin status queries and authentication flow. The useIsAdmin hook is properly integrated with all admin components (AdminDashboard, MonthlyReportPage, Layout) showing loading states and access control.",
