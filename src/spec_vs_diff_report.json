  "summary": "All requirements (REQ-29 through REQ-33) appear to be implemented with extensive console logging added to backend (main.mo) and frontend files (useIsAdmin.ts, AdminDashboard.tsx, Layout.tsx). Backend logging for actor initialization, isCallerAdmin calls, and admin HashSet contents is visible. Frontend logging tracks query execution, actor state, raw responses, and UI rendering decisions. No evidence found for REQ-33 (migration.mo logging), likely due to file truncation.",
